# Text-Processing-Program
This is a text processing tool that allows users to input a block of text and analyze it using several features such as counting words, finding the longest word, counting specific substrings, and identifying unique words. The program offers an interactive menu for performing these analyses and runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
