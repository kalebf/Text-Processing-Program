# Text-Processing-Program
This is a text processing tool that allows users to input a block of text and analyze it using several features such as counting words, finding the longest word, counting specific substrings, and identifying unique words. The program offers an interactive menu for performing these analyses and runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

Features:
Word Count: Splits the input text into words and returns the total count.
Find Longest Word: Identifies and displays the longest word in the text.
Count of Substring: Takes a user-input substring and counts how many times it appears in the text.
Unique Words: Extracts and displays all unique words from the text, filtering out duplicates.
Exit: Allows the user to exit the program after completing the desired analyses.
How to Run:

Run the Python script in a terminal or command line.
Enter a block of text when prompted.
Select an analysis option from the menu by entering the corresponding number (1-5).
The program will display the results of the selected analysis.
You can repeat or exit the program by selecting option 5.
